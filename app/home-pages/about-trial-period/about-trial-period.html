                    The FREE 3-month trial is designed to give you full
                    access to all the features of iBlong2 without it costing you or your organisation
                    a cent. This is not a cut down version with some parts missing. You'll have
                    access to the lot.

                If you give us a go (and we hope you will) then you will be
                asked to enter some details about your organisation so that we can create your account.
                This means you'll need an email address and the name of your organisation and
                you'll need to decide on your user name and password as you will be the administrator
                for your site. That's about all. Its that simple.
