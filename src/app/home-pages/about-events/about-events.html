                Organising events and activities associated with your
                organisation is a job that requires both good organisational skills and great communication
                with your members.

            Whether its a sporting fixture, a formal dinner, an art exhibition,
            a members meeting or a get together of one of your membership interest groups, iBlong2
            can manage member&#39;s acceptances and attendances for you.

                You set up your event in iBlong2, select the members or
                groups of members you want to invite and click a button and iBlong2 will either
                email out or print an invitation.

                If members have email accounts and Internet access they
                can indicate their attendance and any other event related queries you may need them
                to answer.

                You can produce reports showing who is attending, if they
                have any comments such as dietary restrictions and whether they are bringing a guest
                if that option is offered.
