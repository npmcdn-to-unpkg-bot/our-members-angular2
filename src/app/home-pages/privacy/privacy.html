            when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. It is our intention that this policy will

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="Body-textcompact">
            In the course of providing our services, we collect personal information
            in a variety of ways. For example, information is collected when you: make an enquiry
            about our services,or become a client of ours.

        <span class="Body-text"><strong>Information provided by you</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="Body-textcompact">
            You provide personal information directly to us for a specific
            purpose – the management of the membership and activities of a group, association,
            club, society etc. The personal information you provide to us will typically belong
            to 3rd parties (members of such groups for which you are a committee member for
            example). By using iBlong2 you warrant that you have permission from these third
            parties to make such use of their personal information.

        <span class="Body-text"><strong>How we use the information we collect</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="Body-textcompact">
            Personal information that clients submit to our sites is used only
            for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this
            Internet Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Copies of correspondence sent
            from the web site, that may contain personal information, are stored as archives
            for record-keeping and back-up purposes only. You should be aware that we may use
            your email address to contact you in the future. We will never sell or pass on you
            or your member&#39;s details to third parties.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="Body-textcompact">
            We may sometimes use the personal information we collect for a
            secondary purpose, that is, for use in a way different from the original reason
            for collection. We will only do this in the following circumstances:
        </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="Body-textcompact">where you have consented</span></li>
        <li class="Bullet-List-P-P0">
            <span class="Body-textcompact">
                where the secondary purpose is
                directly related to the primary purpose, and you would reasonably expect us to use
                or disclose the information in such a way,
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="Body-textcompact">
                or where we are permitted or required by law, or it is in
                the interests of public safety to do so.

        <span class="Body-textcompact">
            We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal
            information submitted to our site. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
            Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. We do not store credit card or
            other details which may be provided when subscribing to iBlong2. If you provide
            details of your association&#39;s bank account for the purposes of offering your
            members online payment options then this data is securely stored in credential based
            systems. Any page which requests you provide credit card details will be protected
            by SSL security certification. In addition, any employees or contractors who provide
            services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality
            of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be held responsible
            for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.
