                Greetings. We are a husband and wife team living in
                Australia.

            When we retired from the workforce we knew we couldn&#39;t sit
            around doing nothing. We had years of experience working in businesses as varied
            as computer programming, help desk management, computer maintenance, publishing,
            advertising, bee keeping and event management. It just seemed a waste to not try
            to use our skills and experience while doing something that we both enjoyed - software
            programming.

            We had also worked in voluntary capacities on various committees
            both as treasurer and president so we knew how frustrating it can be to handle the
            day to day operations of an active group of people who all have a common interest
            but very little time to spare.

            We designed and built iBlong2 to fill a gap that we believed
            existed for low cost, easy to use and comprehensive software to help those who serve
            on committees or boards of any organisation which has members and which needs to
            manage a membership list, member communications, finances and event co-ordination.
            We also wanted our software to make it easier to hand over all these tasks to new
            committees when they take over these roles.

            We know that not everyone has the time to learn complicated
            software - or the inclination! Every aspect of iBlong2 has been designed to be as
            simple and intuitive as possible. If you find something difficult to understand
            then we definitely want to know about it!

        <span class="Body-text">
            We have recorded dozens of videos which are integrated into
            the system and which show you just how easy it is to perform iBlong2 functions.
            In addition we have written a comprehensive iBlong2 User Guide which is freely available
            for download so you can use it as a handy reference tool.

            We both worked long and hard to bring this software to life
            and we are very grateful to you for taking the time to view our site, read about
            us and iBlong2 and hopefully to give us a try.
