    How iBlong2 Subscriptions Work

        <img class="subscription-image" src="../../../../images/join.png" />
        Subscription
        to iBlong2 depends on the number of members within the organisation. After much
        thought it seemed to us that the fairest model is to count only active members.
        Lapsed members are therefore not counted even though their details are still stored
        in your iBlong2 records.
    </p>

    <div class="subhead">Prices work out at less than 50 cents per member pa.</div>
    <p class="Body-text">
        We wanted to make iBlong2 affordable for even the smallest organisation so our rates
        are constructed accordingly. If your organisation grows and moves into the next
        price bracket within your subscription year we will simply wait and adjust your
        following year&#39;s membership level accordingly when you renew.
